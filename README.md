VFC_2015
========

Legacy code base ... lots of bad practice use of mixed C and C++ ... however, fairly stable but convoluted code ... willl be updated for an intermediate release in 2015 ... then a total rebuild of the tool will comence.  The rebuild will use this tool as part of the code editing tools.  This tool is currently maintained using itself.


Slightly updated legacy code base for the original Visual Flow Coder tools (circa 1999) for WIndows. Updated for Visual Studio 2013 compliation, Win 7/8, multiple monitors, and new support for *.vfc file type.
